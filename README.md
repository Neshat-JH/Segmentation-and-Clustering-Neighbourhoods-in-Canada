# Segmentation-and-Clustering-Neighbourhoods-in-Canada
This notebook is part of Coursera capstone project for the Applied Data Science course. 
The table was scrapped from Wikipedia and data cleaning and wranggling were performed.
Then the K-Means algorithm was used in order to put Toronto areas in clusters.
Folium was used to create a map and for the sake of data visualization
After uploading the Jupyter notebook I found out that my maps are not loaded! After some troubleshooting I figured this is a common error if Microsoft Edge is your default browser (that got changed quickly!!). I have uploaded the pictures of the maps for the reference.
